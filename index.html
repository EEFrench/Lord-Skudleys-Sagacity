      <h2>Welcome to my World!!</h2>
      <h3>My name is Lord Skudley and I play Role Playing Games.”</h3>

      <p>Wait, wait, before you get all excited, I’m talking about the pencil and paper, tabletop Role Playing, not the whips & chains type {not that there is anything wrong with that, occasionally whips & chains come into play in the Game, but only figuratively}.
      <br>
      Quite simply a Role-Playing Game is one where you pretend to be the hero {or villain, depending on the theme of the game} in an epic tale of high adventure.  For example: You inherit a magical object that turns out to be an item coveted by a giant flaming eye.  You must destroy this object in order to destroy the Great Evil.  So, with a group of faithful companions: a warrior, a ranger, a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and three of your childhood friends you set out on this quest.  Along the way you must fight orcs, goblins, a troll, a fiery daemon, and a skulking thing.
      <br>
      Yes, that is a very thinly veiled version of The Lord of the Rings.  But that is exactly what the world’s most well-known RPG is based upon.  Truly, Dungeons & Dragons is almost entirely founded upon the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.  You see, RPG’s allow you to “live” the story in a way outside the confines of the book.
      <br>
      Now before you get on your high horse and expound upon how evil this game is let me tell you about my journey into the “abyss” …
      <br>
      I grew up in the Eighties.  An era based solely on the idea that we all just want to have fun.  Indeed, a most shallow age, and at the same time one full of vibrant emotions.  A period in time where funny glasses made you cool and Devo wore flowerpots as hats.  Madonna wore cones as a bra, and Huey Lewis extolled the Hip-ness of being Square.  But through it all there was one truth: D&D Is Evil!!!  There was even a movie made to illustrate the follies of Role-Playing {it was called Mazes & Monsters and starred a young Tom Hanks as a gamer who went off his nut and killed someone, definitely an eye opener to the terrible end that role playing will bring you}.  I knew this, I was taught this, I wasn’t sure I believed it.  But my parents did, and still do for that matter.  I knew a few “gamers”; they were Dorks.  And coming from me that was a pretty low blow.  After all I was the co-president of the Goon Gang.  But my cozen played D&D, and he wasn’t a Dork, nor was he an evil satin worshiper with pentagrams carved into his arms.  He was just a kid who enjoyed the Game.  Still, I stayed away, because it was evil, but mainly because of the “pseudo-intellects” who tried to sound intelligent, but only succeeded in sounding like a bunch of very dorky gamers.
      <br>
      Then years later, many years later, I met a guy at work who played D&D.  He was a smart guy, he was funny, and {most importantly}, he wasn’t a Dork, nor was he an evil satin worshiper with pentagrams carved into his arms.  He was just a guy who enjoyed the Game.  One day he invited me to his home to watch a session.  I took my daughter and we watched.  I created my first D&D character that night at the age of twenty-seven.  I stayed away from the “magic” wielding characters {after all they were the truly evil aspect of the game}, and instead created a roguish villain called Lord Skudley {he later betrayed the entire party and attempted to kill the psycho dwarven cleric, but that’s another story for another time}.
      <br>
      I learned what a d20 was {a twenty-sided die} and what DM meant {that’s Geek for Dungeon Master.  A DM is the person who runs the game and tells the story, also called a GM [Game Master]}, I bought myself my first set of gaming dice {there are seven dice in a standard d20 set: the d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, d4 and the d%[a d10 that goes from zero to ten]}.   I “rolled” up characters, I learned what a “botch” was, and the difference from a “botch” and a natural twenty {a really bad roll as opposed to a really good roll}, I even learned how to properly cast a “Real” spell…  You go “hommina, hommina, homMINA BANG!!!!” and roll a twenty-sided die.
      <br>
      I once heard how D&D taught the players to cast real spells and that the “Spell Books” contained actual spells from black magic.  But when I looked into these “Real Spells” I found that the only magic they taught was how to roll some dice and consult a chart for the effect of the spell.  There were no chants, no dances {well none beyond the “Hommina, hommina…” thing and a victory dance around the table as you watched the DM cry over yet another defeat as you killed his lead villain that he spent two months creating}, no lightning coming from the fingers, no mysticism, no black robes, and most importantly, there wasn’t Dork-ishness, nor was there any evil satin worshiping with pentagrams carved into our arms.  The Dork-ishness did come later thou, as it must always do in the presence of the Game, but that is part of the fun.
      <br>
      I became a GM of my own gaming group. I taught my kids how to play.  I now run these Evil Games at my own home.  I have even **sigh** LARP’ed {“Live Action Role Playing”, but that’s a story for another time}.</p>
